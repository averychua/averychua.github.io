            <p style="text-align: justify">
                Thank You for Your unconditional love. Thank You for continually blessing me with all the small and big miracles. You never fail to surprise me. Thank You for always bringing me back to the right path specially I when go astray. Help me to always seek You specially when I don’t know which road to take. Thank You for Your gift of grace. I know I am not worthy to deserve it, yet You willingly and freely gave it. Give me the heart to serve, the will to obey and the courage to do what is right in your eyes. All I have are from You thus, help me Lord to give it back to You through the words that I say, my thoughts and my actions. May You always be glorified.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify">
                As each day passes, I find many reasons to love and appreciate you. Yes, we may have our differences and our relationship may not be perfect, however, you have never ceased showing me how precious I am to you. When I can’t bring myself to see that I can succeed, you always let me know that I can and that I will nail it.  Whenever I stumble, you always believe that I’ll be able to get up and pursue my goals.  The things that I have taken for granted turned out to be the very things that keep me strong and confident. For all the little things you do for me and more, I will always treasure in my heart.</p>

            <h4>To the ones who always stand by me </h4>
            <p style="text-align: justify">
                I count each of you as my blessings in disguise. Every action you make and every word you speak spell love and concern. I know you may not be as vocal with regards to showing your love but my heart is full with your subtle expressions of affection. Whenever I am anxious or worried, you make time so I can feel better and see things in a different perspective. I wish I too can be the same person as you are to me. I hope that I can also help you see the beautiful side of things whenever you feel differently. I also hope that I too can lift up your tired spirit and inspire you to soar just as you have done so in mine. Life is definitely better because despite the busyness all around us, you choose to be there for me and stand by me for always.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify">
                I’m sorry I left without saying goodbye. I’m sorry for leaving you hanging all this time. I’m sorry for not giving you the closure you deserved. I’m sorry but I just didn’t see the need to. We were not labeled as a couple. We were just best friends. Although I felt something for you, it quickly disappeared after you kept saying we were nothing more than friends. I didn’t want to go through pain. I didn’t want to experience a heartache. That is why I left. But I guess that was for the better. </p>

            <h4> What Could Have Been </h4>
            <p style="text-align: justify">
                Thank you for making my heart flutter. Thank you for your simple yet sweet handwritten notes. Thank you for being so caring and so understanding. Thank you for always seeing the best in people. We were opposites. You‘re an extrovert, I’m an introvert. You love to sing in front of the crowd, I can’t even stand being in the limelight. You have that burning passion to serve, I couldn’t keep up with you. It was perfect while it lasted. I’m sorry it had to happen and now we can’t bring back the past. Now, we are like two acquaintances acting like we were never close at all in the past. I hope it didn’t turn out that way, but it did. And it’s my fault. Hopefully, in the near future we will be able to talk and be best friends again.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify">
                I loved you so much. I showed you how much you mean the world to me. I gave you all your heart’s desires. I saw you as someone I will spend the rest of my life with —— what a joy that will be. Yet, you chose him over me. Was I not enough? Couldn’t you picture us together forever? Where did I go wrong? Just in a blink of an eye, everything changed. Wonderful memories turned into horrible pain. That was 7 years ago and I still love you. </p>
